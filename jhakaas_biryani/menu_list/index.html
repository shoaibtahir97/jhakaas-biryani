			<dt>Hyderabadi Biryani <b>300 Rs</b></dt>
			<dd>Believed to have originated from the kitchen of the Hyderabad’s Nizam, there are two types of Hyderabadi Biryani – Pakki (cooked) and Kacchi (raw). </dd>		
			<hr/><dt>Lucknowi Biryani <b>350 Rs</b></dt>
			<dd>Also known as the ‘Awadhi biryani’, the Lucknowi Biryani stands out due to its cooking style, known as dum pukht. The meat (or chicken) infused with spices is partially cooked separately from rice, which is flavoured with saffron, star anise and cinnamon.</dd>

			<hr/><dt>Bombay Biryani <b>Rs 400</b></dt>
			<dd>Bombay Biryani is worth the trip to Mumbai in itself. It is composed of chicken (mutton or vegetables), fried and spiced potatoes, kewra water (screw pine) and dried plums that make the flavour distinctively sweet, tangy and aromatic.</dd>
			<hr/><dt>Sindhi Biryani<b>400 Rs</b></dt>
			<dd>Sindhi Biryani is a dish that originated in Sindh province (now part of Pakistan), hence the name. This biryani is made from the generous use of chopped chillies, roasted spices, mint and coriander leaves, onions, nuts, dried fruits and sour yogurt, making the flavour piquant and aromatic. </dd>
			<hr/><dt>Ambur Biryani<b>350 Rs</b></dt>
			<dd>Ambur Biryani is an unmissable travelling experience in itself when visiting Tamil Nadu. Like other variations of biryani, this one also has meat (chicken or mutton), but what makes it different is the way the meat is prepared.  </dd>
			<hr/><dt>Tewhari Biryani<b>280Rs</b></dt>
			<dd>The traditional biryani is made from meat, but Tehari biryani is served without it. Legend has it that this biryani was created for the vegetarian Hindu bookkeepers at the Mughal court</dd>
